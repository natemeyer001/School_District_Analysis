# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
A high school budgeting board wants aggregated standardized test scores for high school students. They suspect faulty test scores from one school and want to remove those scores and analyze the data for trends. Does the size of the school matter? Does the type of the school matter? Does the amount of funding the school gets matter? How do the different grades perform? How many students pass both math and reading?
