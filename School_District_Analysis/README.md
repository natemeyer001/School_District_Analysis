# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
A high school budgeting board suspects faulty test scores from one grade in a school in their district. They want the district analyzed with the entire data, and the re-analyzed after the questionable data has been removed. Does removing the data affect the district summary? In addition, are there any trends with the size of the school? Does the type of the school affect test scores? Does the amount of funding the school gets matter? How do the different grades perform?
